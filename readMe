Bell Watchdog README
Introduction
Bell Watchdog is a part of the Bell System Monitoring tool, designed to monitor and report various system metrics in real-time. This document focuses on the client-side application, which collects and sends metrics to a central server via WebSocket.

Prerequisites
For a more specific guide tailored to Linux distributions where the Bell Watchdog can be effectively used and noting the requirement of root privileges for setup and installation, please see the modified section below:

System Requirements
Operating System: The client script is compatible with Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, and other Linux-based operating systems.
Python Version: Python 3.6 or later.
Network Access: Ensure access to the internet or a local network where the WebSocket server is hosted.

Installation
This installation guide assumes you are operating as the root user. If you're not logged in as root, you can switch to the root user by executing su and entering the root password, or you can prefix commands with sudo where applicable.

System Utilities
The script relies on certain utilities to gather system metrics. Install the sysstat package to enable the collection of CPU, memory, I/O, and other important system statistics.

On Debian/Ubuntu systems, use the following command:
apt-get update && apt-get install sysstat

For CentOS/RHEL systems, execute:
yum install sysstat

Python Environment Setup
It's recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects to manage dependencies effectively.

Install virtualenv if you haven't already:
apt-get install python3-virtualenv

Create a virtual environment in your project directory:
virtualenv venv

Activate the virtual environment:
source venv/bin/activate

Install Python Packages
With the virtual environment activated, install the necessary Python packages using pip:
pip install socketio-client asyncio psutil watchdog

On Debian 12:
pip install socketio-client asyncio psutil watchdog --break-system-packages

Configuration
Before running the Bell Watchdog, ensure you have configured the WebSocket server's URL in your project. This typically involves setting a variable or a configuration file within the project to specify the WebSocket server address.

Running the Client
To start the client application and begin monitoring, run the following command from your project directory:

cd /path/to/your/project && python3 -m app debug

Replace directory with the name of your main Python project location if it's different.

For the client version setup and management as a systemd service, follow these guidelines. This guide will help you to set up the Bell Watchdog as a service that can start automatically at boot and can be controlled manually through systemd commands. This setup requires root or sudo privileges on your Linux system.

Creating a Systemd Service File for the Watchdog
Locate the Example Service File:
An example service file is provided at /install/service/bell_sys_monitor_client.service. Review this file for an understanding of how the service is configured.

Create Your Service File:
Copy the example service file to the /etc/systemd/system/ directory and name it according to your preference, for instance, bell_sys_monitor_client.service.

cp /path/to/your/project/install/service/bell_sys_monitor_client.service /etc/systemd/system/bell_sys_monitor_client.service

Edit the Service File:
You might need to edit the service file to match your project's specific paths and settings. Use your preferred text editor to open the file:

nano /etc/systemd/system/bell_sys_monitor_client.service
vi nano /etc/systemd/system/bell_sys_monitor_client.service

Make necessary adjustments to paths and user/group settings as per your setup.

Setting up as Root
Given the nature of system monitoring, running the script with root privileges ensures comprehensive access to system metrics. This guide is written with the assumption that operations are performed as root. If you're using a non-root account, ensure you have sufficient permissions by being a part of the sudoers group or by acquiring necessary permissions through other means.

Managing the Watchdog Service
Start the service:
systemctl start bell_sys_monitor_client

Stop the service:
systemctl stop bell_sys_monitor_client

Restart the service: This is useful after making changes to the service configuration or your client application.
systemctl restart bell_sys_monitor_client

Enable auto-start at boot:
systemctl enable bell_sys_monitor_client

Disable auto-start at boot:
systemctl disable bell_sys_monitor_client

Check service status:
systemctl status bell_sys_monitor_client

Viewing Logs
To view the logs for your Watchdog, use:
journalctl -u bell_sys_monitor_client.service

This command displays the log messages generated by your client application. Use the -f flag with journalctl to follow the log output in real-time.

Note
This README serves as a guide for deploying the Bell Watchdog as a systemd service. Depending on your specific project requirements, including dependencies, environment setup, and execution paths, you may need to adjust the service file and systemd commands accordingly. Ensure the client script is set up to run properly as the main entry point for your monitoring tasks.
